# Summarization of a Desktop Environment (DE)

A desktop environment is a group of software that runs on top of an operating system and forms the desktop's graphical user interface (GUI)3. It typically includes everything from the appearance and feel of the windows to the style of the icons, files, folders, and mouse pointers2. A desktop environment also includes applications and tools that enable users to interact with computers and complete different tasks2.

To create a computer desktop experience, you must be familiar with programming languages, graphical libraries, windowing systems, and user interface design. Depending on the operating system, you may also need to adhere to some standards and specifications in order to guarantee compatibility and interoperability with other software.


The following are some of the steps required in creating a desktop environment:

- Select a programming language that meets your requirements and tastes. C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript2 are some of the most commonly used languages for desktop applications.
- Select a graphical library that includes elements and components for building graphical interfaces. Qt, GTK, wxWidgets, and Tkinter2 are examples of popular frameworks.
- Select a windowing system that manages communication between your desktop environment and the operating system. X11, Wayland, Mir, and Windows2 are examples of popular windowing platforms.

- Create the appearance and feel of your desktop environment, including the color scheme, fonts, icons, themes, wallpapers, and widgets too.

- Create the fundamental components of your desktop environment, such as the window manager, panel, file manager, launcher, and settings manager.

- Create or integrate additional applications and tools that add functionality and features to your desktop environment, such as a web browser, text editor, terminal emulator, calculator, media player, and so on2.2. - Make your desktop environment available to users who want to test it out or use it as their default GUI2.

It is not an easy job to create a desktop environment. It takes a significant amount of work, effort, creativity, and technical skills. It can, however, be rewarding and enjoyable if you appreciate creating software and customizing the appearance and behavior of your computer. There are numerous current desktop environments that you can use for inspiration or as a resource.
